> *“Where rules are not obstacles, but frames: turning playlists into a new art form.”*

## About the Project
This project is about building a playlist generator that obeys rules with absolute fidelity, turning the act of curation into an art form of its own—where each constraint frames the music like a gallery frame around a painting, reshaping listening into a new perspective.

Unlike traditional AI playlist tools that bend or break rules to optimize recommendations, this project treats **constraints as sacred**. The rules you define are the canvas; the music is the paint; the playlist is the artwork.

## Core Principles
- **Rigidity to Rules**: If you set a constraint, the system never cheats.  
- **Constraints as Creativity**: Rules are the spark, not the limitation.  
- **Transparency**: Every track shows *why* it was chosen.  
- **Personal First**: Built for individual empowerment.  
- **Community Next**: Designed to grow into an open, collaborative space.

## Roadmap
- **Phase 1**: Personal prototype (rule engine, Spotify/MusicBrainz integration).  
- **Phase 2**: Expand rules, add flow/scoring, improve transparency.  
- **Phase 3**: Community features—share, remix, and fork rulesets.

## Get Involved
This project will be open-source. Contributions, ideas, and creative rule challenges are welcome once the foundation is stable. For now, the focus is on building a strong, reliable core.

## Vision
Playlists are more than collections of songs—they can be curated exhibitions, structured compositions, or playful experiments. By treating rules as art, this project reimagines the playlist as a medium of expression in its own right.
